# This file is a collection of server commands to help keep your Minecraft server running smoothly.
# To add a new command, simply add it as an uncommented (no '#' prefix) to the end of this file.
# To disable a preconfigured command, you can either comment the command (add a '#' prefix) or just 
#   delete the line.
# NOTE: As this server uses Paper, the '/' prefix is uneccessary and will actually cause issues!
# NOTE: Commands are case-sensitive! Any leading or trailing white space, misspelled names, etc.
#   will cause the command to fail.
